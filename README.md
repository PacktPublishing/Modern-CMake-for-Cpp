This is the code repository for [Modern CMake for C++](https://www.packtpub.com/product/modern-cmake-for-c/9781801070058), published by Packt.

**Discover a better approach to building, testing, and packaging your software**

## What is this book about?
Creating top-notch software is an extremely difficult undertaking. Developers researching the subject have difficulty determining which advice is up-to-date and which approaches have already been replaced by easier, better practices. At the same time, most online resources offer limited explanation, while also lacking the proper context and structure.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand best practices for building C++ code
* Gain practical knowledge of the CMake language by focusing on the most useful aspects
* Use cutting-edge tooling to guarantee code quality with the help of tests and static and dynamic analysis
* Discover how to manage, discover, download, and link dependencies with CMake
* Build solutions that can be reused and maintained in the long term
* Understand how to optimize build artifacts and the build process itself

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
function(Inner)
  message("  > Inner: ${V}")
  set(V 3)
  message("  < Inner: ${V}")
endfunction()

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
The book is for build engineers and software developers with knowledge of C/C++ programming who are looking to learn CMake to automate the process of building small and large software solutions. If you are someone who's just getting started with CMake, a long-time GNU Make user, or simply looking to brush up on the latest best practices, this book is for you.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-13).
